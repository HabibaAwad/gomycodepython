    "After removing all the common characters, count the total no. of remaining characters then create a result list with FLAMES acronym i.e [“Friends”, “Love”, “Affection”, “Marriage”, “Enemy”, “Siblings”]. Now start removing words one by one until the list does not contain only one word, using the total count which we got. the word which remains in the last, is the result.\n",

    "FLAMES is a popular game named after the acronym: Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, Sibling. This game does not accurately predict whether or not an individual is right for you, but it can be fun to play this with your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multipurpose language and one can do literally anything with it. Python can also be used for game development. Let’s create a simple FLAMES game without using any external game libraries like PyGame.\n",

    "There are two steps in this game:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the two names.\n",
    "Remove the common characters with their respective common occurrences.\n",
    "Get the count of the characters that are left.\n",
    "Take FLAMES letters as [“F”, “L”, “A”, “M”, “E”, “S”]\n",
    "Start removing letters using the count we got.\n",
    "The letter which lasts the process is the result.\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "\n",
    "Input :   player1 name : AJAY\n",
    "\n",
    "          player 2 names: PRIYA\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Relationship status: Friends\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In the above given, two names A and Y are common letters that are occurring one time(common count) in both names, so we are removing these letters from both names. Now count the total letters that are left here it is 5. Now start removing letters one by one from FLAMES using the count we got and the letter which lasts the process is the result.\n",
